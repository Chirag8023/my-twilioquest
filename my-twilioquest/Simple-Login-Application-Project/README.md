## Setting up the project for Offline run

- Before starting this project, run `npm install` command in your git bash terminal which opened in the project directory.
- Now you are ready to start the application, with `npm start`.
- This application will now be running on `localhost:3000`.
- You may want to use `ngrok` to generate a public URL for the application if you plan to use the POST route, or to receive requests from outside your network.
